 * Thread configuration for each thread. Make sure it matches the number above.

 *                  2: Double mode will work on two blocks at the same time, but will require 4MB cache.
 *
 *                  Double mode can be used if you have too much cache compared to the number of cores, or
 *                  can be used to save power by freeing some up cores for idling or other work.
 *                  Double threads are only about 80-85% as effective as two single threads.
 *

 *                  things slower.
 *
 * affine_to_cpu -  This can be either false (no affinity), or the CPU core number. Note that on hyperthreading 
 *                  systems it is better to assign threads to physical cores. On Windows this usually means selecting 
 *                  even or odd numbered cpu numbers. For Linux it will be usually the lower CPU numbers, so for a 4 
 *                  physical core CPU you should select cpu numbers 0-3.
 *
 * On the first run the miner will look at your system and suggest a basic configuration that will work,
 * you can try to tweak it from there to get the best performance. Read TUNING.txt for more information.
 * 
 * A filled out configuration should look like this:
